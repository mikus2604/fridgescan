Modern Design Trends Checklist — Kitchen & Grocery Scanning App

🧼 1. Minimalist, Content-Focused UI

☐ Clean layouts, clear hierarchy, lots of white space

☐ Limit main actions: Scan, List, History, Settings

☐ Large readable typography

☐ Neutral/light backgrounds with high contrast text

☐ Prominent “Scan Item” button (main CTA)



---

⚡ 2. Micro-Interactions & Feedback

☐ Subtle animations for scan success/failure

☐ Small motion cues on add/remove actions

☐ Smooth transitions between screens

☐ Confetti/checkmark animation after scan success

☐ Keep animations under ~300ms for snappiness



---

🧠 3. Personalization & Smart UI

☐ Suggest frequently scanned items or auto-add options

☐ “Favourite” items for quick access

☐ Smart reminders for low-stock or expiry

☐ Personalized home screen cards (“You might need milk soon”)

☐ Allow user to control personalization settings



---

👆 4. Gesture-Based & Simplified Navigation

☐ Use bottom nav bar for core actions

☐ One-tap access to Scan (floating action button ideal)

☐ Swipe gestures for list management (mark used/delete)

☐ Keep nav reachable with one hand (bottom half of screen)

☐ Avoid deep menu hierarchies



---

🌗 5. Dark Mode & Adaptive Theme

☐ Offer both light/dark themes

☐ Auto-switch based on device setting or lighting

☐ Maintain contrast and readability in both modes

☐ Test camera overlay visibility under dark mode



---

🎨 6. Friendly Illustrations & Icons

☐ Use custom icons for food categories (fruits, dairy, pantry)

☐ Friendly, minimal illustration style for onboarding and empty states

☐ Avoid generic stock photos

☐ Keep consistent color palette and illustration tone



---

♿ 7. Accessibility & Inclusive Design

☐ Buttons ≥ 44px tall & spaced adequately

☐ High color contrast (WCAG-compliant)

☐ Voice input or hands-free scanning option

☐ Descriptive error messages (“Barcode not found — try again”)

☐ Screen-reader labels for icons and controls



---

🍳 8. Kitchen Context Optimization

☐ Large buttons for one-handed use

☐ Quick “auto-scan” mode from launch

☐ Offline functionality or caching

☐ Minimal steps from scan → confirmation → list update

☐ Use bright colors that remain visible in kitchen lighting



---

💡 9. Onboarding & Empty States

☐ Short, visual onboarding (2–3 slides max)

☐ “Scan your first item” illustration on empty list

☐ Friendly tone (“Let’s stock up your kitchen!”)

☐ Provide skip option for onboarding



---

🧩 10. Brand & Feel

☐ Warm, household color palette (earthy neutrals, greens, oranges)

☐ Rounded shapes → friendlier appearance

☐ Use micro-copy that sounds approachable (“Nice scan!”)

☐ Keep visual tone consistent across all screens
